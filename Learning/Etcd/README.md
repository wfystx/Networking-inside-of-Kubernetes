Learning about Etcd.    

Etcd is a crucial component for Kubernetes as it stores the entire state of the cluster: its configuration, specifications, and the statuses of the running workloads.    
Etcd is defined as a distributed, reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system.       
Etcd is deployed as a cluster, several nodes whose communications are handled by the Raft algorithm.
